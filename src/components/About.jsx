                <p><em>Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result.</em><br />
                - Letters of Oscar Wilde</p>
                <p>Mathematically this is known as "likelihood" - it's a fun concept to mull over. 
                    I enjoy STEM topics, but find the most joy in creating experiences for others. 
                    Whether it be for my professional teams, or for my D&D teams, 
                    I love to create experiences where people grow and find success.

                <h3>As A Developer</h3>
                <p>As an interactive developer, my primary aim is to create an experience and 
                    communicate an understanding of the user while effectively representing a 
                    brand's voice in the applications I build. I am versed in numerous web development technologies including, but not limited to - 
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node, Express, and MySQL. My current studies include 
                    Three.js, React and Yuka AI. One thing I love about this industry is that there 
                    is always something new to learn. </p>
