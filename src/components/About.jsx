                <h3>As A Team Leader</h3>
                <p>I have 11 years of experience leading teams in multiple industries. In my my early years, I built teams and operations
                    for several new local businesses which grew to succeed and break even within their first year. Most recently, I 
                    had the opportunity to expand an existing team, hiring on 18 new members, and can tout a 100% retention rate of team members and reaching 150% of 
                    the financial goal for that season. I am keen on motivation analysis and empathetic communication. My teams know that
                    I am there to be a resource with their best interests at heart. My aim is to create a habit of success ensured by skill
                    development and thorough communication.

                <h3>As A Creator</h3>
                <p><em>Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result.</em><br />
                - Letters of Oscar Wilde</p>
                <p>Mathematically this is known as "likelihood" - it's a fun concept to mull over. 
                    I enjoy STEM topics, but find the most joy in creating experiences for others. 
                    Whether it be for my professional teams, or for my D&D teams, 
                    I love to create experiences where people grow and find success.

                <h3>As A Developer</h3>
                <p>As an interactive developer, my primary aim is to create an experience and 
                    communicate an understanding of the user while effectively representing a 
                    brand's voice in the applications I build. I am versed in numerous web development technologies including, but not limited to - 
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node, Express, and MySQL. My current studies include 
                    Three.js, React and Yuka AI. One thing I love about this industry is that there 
                    is always something new to learn. </p>
